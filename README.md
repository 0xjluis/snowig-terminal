# Snowfall Simulation in Node.js Console

This Node.js project simulates snowfall in the console using a grid-based approach. It is a simple and visually appealing terminal-based animation.

## Features

- **Grid System**: The display is represented as a grid of characters, with different characters representing empty space, snow, and falling snow.
- **Movement**: The simulation includes logic to move the snow downwards and diagonally, creating a realistic falling effect.
- **Performance**: The rendering of each frame is controlled to manage the refresh rate and ensure smooth animation.
- **Customization**: The grid size, characters used for display, and other parameters can be customized easily.

## How it Works

- The display is initialized as a 2D grid filled with an empty character.
- Snow is added to random positions at the top of the grid.
- Each cycle, the snow moves down one position. If the spot directly below is occupied, the snow moves diagonally to the left or right.
- The display is parsed into a string and printed to the console, creating a frame of animation.
- This process repeats, creating the effect of falling snow.

## Usage

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. **Running the Simulation**: Use the following command to run the simulation:
    ```bash
    node yourScriptFileName.js
    ```
3. **Customization**: Modify the `width`, `height`, and other parameters in the script to customize the simulation.

## Note

- The simulation is designed to run in the console. It uses `readline` to manage console output.
- It's a basic simulation and does not handle user input or complex animation scenarios.

Enjoy watching the virtual snowfall in your console!
